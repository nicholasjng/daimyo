# daimyo: A simple Python build backend based on ninja

This is a personal project to improve my understanding of PEP517-compatible Python package build systems, and to get some experience with ninja.

⚠️ This is not production-ready software - use with caution.

## Requirements

* A ninja distribution available on the current PATH.
* A Python >=3.10 interpreter.
* For all reasonable uses (i.e., non-Python language extensions), a C++ toolchain installed on the current system.
